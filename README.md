   After emergency treatment，the girl came to.I felt at ease when I knew that she had only suffered from minor bone fractures and would recover in a couple of weeks.I left the hospital without giving my name，but my heart was full of joy and peace.Not until then did I understand the meaning of the proverb："Helping others is the source of happiness."This may be the most unforgettable experience of my life.
确实是这样改才对
